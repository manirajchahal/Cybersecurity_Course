   - Work through problems together

### How to Ask Good Questions
‚ùå Bad: "It doesn't work"
‚úÖ Good: "I'm trying to run nmap on localhost (Week 2, Lab 1), but getting 'permission denied'. I tried running it with sudo but still not working. Screenshot attached."

## üîí Safety and Ethics

### Golden Rules
1. **Only test systems you own or have permission to test**
2. **Never use these skills illegally**
3. **Respect privacy and data**
4. **Follow the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act**
